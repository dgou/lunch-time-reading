Lunch Time Reading / Viewing List
=================================

A curated list of reading/viewing material; each article is short enough to "read over lunch".
(Note: Videos can be longer)

Programming/Tech heavy with a QE/QA bent, but articles range all over.
Organization is rough, and new material is welcome. (PRs are very welcome!)

`Naming your personal scripts/aliases with commas <http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/>`_ -
Brandon Rhodes -
One why naming your personal scripts/aliases with a comma is a good idea.
Is "really about" name spaces in disguise, as well as structuring things for human ease of use.

Behavior Driven Development / Gherkin / Testing

jdalbey -
Three myths about software testing.
Doug: I take some exception to the idea that unit tests are only to find bugs. With TDD (even on legacy code), unit tests serve as executable design/requirements and are the gutters along the fairway that keep my bowling ball from hitting the pins in someone else's lane.

Two great articles about why project estimation is such a loathsome, but essential, task and
how we can make peace with it in an agile world.

This is the heart of QE, happy-path/down-the-fairway must work, but all the rest of it, the corner cases, the specs to know which are which, are so much more. And they take a lot more resources.

Parallels/dove-tails nicely with the story in The Phoenix Principle.
